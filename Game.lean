Title "Abstract Algebra Game"
Introduction
"
Hi There! Welcome to the Abstract Algebra Game, you'll start off in tutorial world where
you will pick up the tactics needed to solve the exercises in further worlds.

The central idea is that we start with a very general and 'simple' structure with a Semigroup,
then as we add axioms we can prove more and more results as we gain more and more 'structure'.
