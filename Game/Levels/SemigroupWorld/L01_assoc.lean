Introduction "
Our first example of an algebraic structure is a **semigroup**. A semigroup `S` is a set on which an associative binary operation `*` has been defined.

This means that for all elements `a` and `b` in `S`, the product `a * b` is an element of `S` and for all elements `a, b c` in `S`, the following is true: `(a * b) * c = a * (b * c)`.

We call this the **associative law** and is the only axiom.

Note that Lean will display `(a * b) * c` as `a * b * c`.

Check that the associative rule holds by writing `rewrite [mul_assoc]` followed by a `rfl`.

This Axiom states that our binary operation has the following property:
 $g * (h * k)  = (g * h) * k$ for all $g, h, k âˆˆ G$.
Then we say that the binary operation * is associative
