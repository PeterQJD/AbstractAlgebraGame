Title "Tutorial World"

Introduction "
In this game we will learn how to prove basic facts about different algebraic structures.

These facts (and the game itself) are written in a programming language called Lean. This language is special because it can be used as a **formal proof assistant**.

This means that it accepts precise mathematical statements and it will tell you if a proof of such a statement is correct.

One way we can construct proofs in Lean is by using **tactics**.

In the first world of our game, we will learn how to use some of these tactics.

Let's dive in!
