Title "Magmas"

Introduction "To start we will be giving names to many
structures you will have met before. The most basic of these
 is the magma which consists of a set with a binary operation on it.
 An example of this is the natural numbers and addition $(\\N, +)$"

Statement {α : Type} (s : Set α) (b_op : α → α → α) : ∃ M : MyCommMagma := by
  let M : MyMagma := {
    carrier := s
    binary_operation := b_op
  }
  apply Exists.intro M
  rfl

Conclusion "Good Work!"
