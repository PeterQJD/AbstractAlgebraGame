Title "Group World"

Introduction
"
# Welcome to Group World!

Just like the structures encountered in our previous worlds.
Now we have went a step further with yet more 'structure', with three main axioms now at our disposal.
Associativity (of the binary operation), existance of an identity element and existance of inverse elements.

The tactics used will be predominatley `rw`, 'have' and 'constructor'.
