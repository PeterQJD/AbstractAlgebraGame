Introduction

## Welcome to Monoid World!

A monoid is a semigroup with the added axiom of an identity element,
which is an element of the set which when applied to any element of the set,
leaves it unchanged, it is effectivley the 'do nothing' element.

Please note that because all monoids are semigroups, therefore all monoids have an associative binary operation,
hence we can use mul_assoc when we please.

The tactics used will be predominatley rewrites.
